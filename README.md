# Project Name

This project is a solution developed using various technologies to provide APIs and services following the Clean Architecture design pattern. 
It uses .NET 7, Entity Framework (EF), and Docker.

## Technology Used

- **.NET 7**: The project is developed using .NET 7, which provides a framework for building APIs and services.
- **Entity Framework (EF)**: EF is used as the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool for communicating with the database.
- **Docker**: Docker is used to create Docker images and run the application in containers.

## Steps to Run the Solution

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. **Run the Application**:
   - Build the solution using .NET 7.
   - Run the application to start the API and services.
   - docker-compose can be used as well

4. Use the application's endpoints to interact with the API and perform desired operations.

Note: Make sure you have the necessary prerequisites installed on your machine, including Docker and .NET 7.

## Additional Information

Due to time shortage, the current implementation uses EF with an in-memory database. 
This is for demonstration and development purposes only. 
In a production environment, a persistent database should be used, such as PostgreSQL or SQL Server, and the connection string and configuration should be updated accordingly.
